## 2025_KIDDS: Tutorial and lecture note materials presented in 2025 KIDDS workshop. 
  Elemenetary level tutorial for Cheminformatics beginners
  1. Basic handling: download a dataset from therapeutic and use RDKit to handle molecule object
  2. Structure editing with RDKit: editing molecular structures with RDKit
  3. Reaction-based generation: generation of new molecular structures with pre-defined fragments and reaction templates
  4. Binary classification: train logistic regression and support vector machine models, and evaluate classification results 
  5. Molecular docking: practice PDB pre-processing and molecular docking with Vina
  6. Interaction analysis: analyze protein-ligand interactions by using PLIP
